# Customer_Lifetime_value_Analysis
I have created a Customer Lifetime Value Analysis model using python,where I have used several packages of python like Matplotlib,Pandas,Numpy,Sklearn and Seaborn which helped us in building a model to determine the CLV value generated by different channels. I have tried to explain each and every command used,its significance and the result i.e. there outputs are also explained .
Customer lifetime value analysis is used to estimate the total value of customers to the business over the lifetime of their relationship. It helps companies determine how much to invest in customer acquisition and retention, as well as identify the most valuable customers to prioritize for retention efforts.
